Using a previous homework problem with code from our stanley/penguin language as 
your guide, write an assembly program using nasm or ARM called findGCD.nasm or 
findGCD.arm which will find the GCD of the two numbers. Test your program using 
the numbers 3113041662 and 11570925 which should produce the value 462837. Read the 
two numbers from the keyboard at port stdin and write the result to port stdout.
