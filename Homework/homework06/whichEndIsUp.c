/*
In networking, it is necessary to make sure that bytes are transimitted in the proper order so the receiving device can interpret them 
correctly. This requires that big-endian and little-endian values are converted to something called Network Byte Order before they are 
transmitted. For this problem, write a C program whichEndIsUp.c that will determine whether your computer is big-endian or little-endian 
as was discussed in class.
