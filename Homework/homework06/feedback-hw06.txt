SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 findGCD.nasm
   works as advertised
   you have a TON of code in here, much of which is things we didn't cover
      in class.  I can't help but think you must have gotten some help from
      the Internet or from an AI assistant which you DIDN'T CITE.  Of course
      I have no way to prove that....  still from now on, in your future
      classes, PLEASE CITE WHERE YOU GOT YOUR HELP!
   you also made it hard on yourselves by NOT using "scanf()" and "printf()"
      to handle the prompting and entering.  You could do the whole thing in
      far fewer lines of code by doing it that way instead of using the
      print loop and parsing stuff...  just sayin'.....

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c
   I had to make several changes for you where there were misspelled words.
      Usually I don't make those kinds of changes, I just kick back the
      assignment for YOU to fix.  However, since the semester is over and
      the changes were minor I made them for you at a small cost of points.
   NOW works as advertised

problem 3 paritygen.nasm
   works as advertised

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c
   another problem: you didn't put the ".h" on the end of your include file
      names.  I added those for you as well.  YOU REALLY NEED TO CHECK YOUR
      CODE BEFORE YOU SUBMIT FOR SCORE!!  There is no way this would compile
      properly if you were following the instructions given in class.  Is it
      possible that you are using an IDE like VSCode that is fixing these
      mistakes behind the scenes so that you aren't even aware of them?  If
      so, that is a DANGEROUS habit to be forming this early on....
   NOW works as advertised

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c
   OK, sorry, I give up.  You have made the same mistakes in these remaining
      files and I'm not going to fix any more of them.  You obviously didn't
      check out this code before you committed it, since there is no way it
      would compile without rework.
   no credit for this one.

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm
   no credit for this one either.

SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   Homework01  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   Homework02   80.00% of  5 points =  4.00 points
   Homework03  107.00% of  5 points =  5.35 points
   Homework04   97.78% of  5 points =  4.89 points
   Homework05   80.00% of 10 points =  8.00 points
   homework06   65.85% of 15 points =  9.88 points
                      semester total: 37.12 out of 45.00 = 82.49%
                             which is a B-minus

I'm not sure what happened at the end of the semester here.  You seemed to
slip quite a bit.  I wish you had come to more office hours for help on the
homework so that you could have done better.

PLEASE feel free to come to my office hours if you have questions on any of
your other classes!  My door will always be open to you and I will try my
very best to help you with whatever I can!

Nevertheless, it's been wonderful having you four in class this semester!
Best wishes for a great holiday break and I look forward to seeing you all
around campus in the spring!
