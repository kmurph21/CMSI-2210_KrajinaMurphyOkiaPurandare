SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1, your answer is a bit simplistic.  A computer system is more than
   the Von Neumann architecture.  Think of the Internet as a giant computer
   and you'll see what I mean.

problem 3, a compiled language uses a compiler to translate human-readable
   code into assembly code and then into machine code which can be executed
   on the processor; the operations happen BEFORE the program runs.  An
   interpreted language translates the human-readable code directly into
   the machine instructions line-by-line as it is read and executes each of
   the instructions through an 'interpreter' program.  Testing/debugging the
   code is an entirely separate issue.

problem 9, don't forget that there are LOTS of options you can use with the
   "ls" command to get more information and/or format the output!

problem 12, the answer "fetch, decode, execute" is all that was needed.  The
   CPU, memory, and I/O system are parts of the computer system but actually
   have little to do with the "Von Neumann" architecture.  The problem asked
   for the "three steps", not the parts.

problem 14, your answer misses the point.  Your answer describes ONE TYPE of
   register but there are many more types.  A register is a small, very fast
   memory unit that is part of the CPU.

problem 16, "cmp rdi, rsi" is NOT machine language, it is assembly code.  The
   machine language is ALWAYS only ones and zeros.  Your "yes" answer is not
   correct, but your explanation is right.

Otherwise, nice job!
