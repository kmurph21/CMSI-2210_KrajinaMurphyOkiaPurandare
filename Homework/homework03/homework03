The purpose of these exercises is to help you develop your skill. Please do all these problems without using a computer or calculator. 
Taking the time to practice will give you a MUCH better ability and understanding of the processes.

NOTE: Questions about carry and overflow assume signed modular arithmetic, NOT saturated arithmetic.

SECOND NOTE: If you write these out and show your work, you can get partial credit. 
Even though each problem is worth one point, you can still get 0.25 point, 0.5 point, or even 0.9 point if you show your calculations. 
However, if you are 100% SURE that your answer is correct, feel free to only submit the answer.

These problems are difficult and will require you to do some research to get the answers. 
You may use websites if you wish to find the answers, as long as you include a URL link to the page you used. 
These problems are considered optional and you will get extra credit for getting them correct, one point per problem. 
For any you attempt for which your answer is incorrect, you will NOT be penalized, you just won't get any credit for that one problem.
NOTE: float means floating point, a number with a decimal point in it like 123.45. 
The terms 'single precision float' and '32-bit float' are treated as the same thing.
