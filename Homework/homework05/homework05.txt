1. Write a C program, dec2bin.c to convert a base-10 number to its 32-bit binary value equivalent. 
You may take the base-10 number in from the command line, or you may prompt the user for the number
and read in her response [your option]. Your output should be a string of binary digits which correspond
to the base-10 value. For example, running the program with dec2bin 65535 [or just dec2bin if asking the 
user] should produce the output string 00000000000000001111111111111111. Use unsigned integers.
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stlib.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  unisgned int num;
  if (argc==2) {
    num=(unsigned int)atoi(argv[1]);
  }
  else {
    printf("Enter a base 10 number:");
    scanf("%u", &num);
  }
  char binary[33];
  binary[32]='\0';
  for(int i=31; i>=0; i--) {
    binary[i]=num(num&1)?'1':'0';
    num>>=1;
  }
  printf("%s\n", binary);
  return 0;
}

2. Write a C program like problem #1 to to make the program dec2hex.c which will output the 32-bit or 
64-bit [8-digit or 16-digit] hexidecimal equivalent of its input. For this modification, you must also
handle an optional command line argument which indicates the number of digits the output hex value will 
contain, either 8 or 16. This will be the second argument on the line and if it is omitted the program 
will default to 32-bit. For example, running the program with dec2hex 65535 8 should produce the output 
string 0x0000FFFF, andrunning with dec2hex 65535 16 should result in the output string 0x000000000000FFFF.
If asking the user for input, both values should be asked for using separate prompts. If getting the 
values from the command line, accept a space-delimited list of two numbers. Use unsigned integers for 
this problem. [HINT: check out the printf() output format specification — you'll find some help there 
to make things easier.]

3. Write a C program timesTables.cto output the times tables from 2 to N, where N is a user-defined 
number take from the command line. Output the values in a nice table, using a format specifier that 
will allow for enough space for the results to be neatly aligned in columns.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        printf("Usage: %s <N>\n", argv[0]);
        return 1;
    }

    int N = atoi(argv[1]); // turn command-line argument into an integer

    printf("Times Tables from 2 to %d:\n\n", N);

    
    for (int i = 1; i <= 12; i++) {
        for (int j = 2; j <= N; j++) {
            printf("%4d", i * j); // print each product in its own column
        }
        printf("\n"); // new line after each row
    }

    return 0;
}


4. Write a C program holdit.c that times you as you hold your breath. The program must put out a short 
message that has instructions on what to do, which should read something like,
"This program will time how long you can hold your breath. Take a deep breath, then press the 'Enter' 
key. When you absolutely have to exhale, press the enter key again. The duration will be displayed 
in minutes and seconds."
You will need to research the way the time functions work in C.

5. Write a C program wordcount.c that counts the number of words in a file of text. Your program should 
take a file name as a command line argument. As you read the file contents, keep a count of the number 
of words which are separated by "whitespace". [Research what is meant by "whitespace" in the C 
environment.] When the file has been completely read, close the file and write out the number of 
words. Be sure you handle error conditions like files that don't exist or errors encountered while 
reading the file. You should also be able to handle files that are in different directories from where 
your program resides.
